It's easyer way, using cron and AWSCLI
-
1) Enter AWS IAM and create user with only CloudWatch rights
Then go to Security Credantials tab of new user and create access key pair
-
2) Enter an instance and install AWSCLI. It's possible with various Pocket Managers and it could be enougth.
(Awazon recomends to do it with PIP( Pithon ) because of the newest version in PIP repo )
$ sudo apt-get install AWSCLI
$ sudo rpm install AWSCLI
$ sudo yum install AWSCLI
-
3) Configure AWSCLI with user credantials from p.1)
$ aws configure
or edit config file with text editor, like this:
$ AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE( put your access key pair )
$ AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY( put your access key pair )
$ Default region name [None]: us-west-2( put your region )
$ Default output format [None]: json
-
Now you can check the possiblity to send custom metric from cli to your CloudWatch
It should be mentioned that he does not immediately process it, it may take about 15 minutes
$ aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name NAME --dimensions Instance=i-0c51f9f1213e63159  --namespace "Custom" --value SOME_NUMERIC_VALUE
Instance is your ec2 instance id. You can check it at ec2 pane. We of course should to know which instance or server.
-
4) Create bash script
$ touch script.sh
$ chmod +x script.sh
$ nano script.sh
-
#!/bin/bash
if (( $(ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep YOUR_SERVICE | wc -l) > 0 ))
then
  aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name mongo-bool --dimensions Instance=i-04cc5eb47w76ef922  --namespace "Custom" --value 0
else
  aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name mongo-bool --dimensions Instance=i-04cc5eb47w76ef922  --namespace "Custom" --value 1
fi
-
0 is ok, 1 is alarm
than add the script to a cron
$ crontab -e
- add / to execute every minute for example
$ */1 * * * * /home/user/script.sh
-
5) Go to your AWS CloudWatch tab and set alarm for newly appeared custom metric.
It can be fully installed in Creating Alarm dialog with default SNS topic creation and email addres adding.
You need to verify an email addres adding and then verify of getting alarms on it.
