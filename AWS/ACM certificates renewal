Certificates created by AWS ACM can be AUTOMATICALLY updated in three ways:
1) Using private CAs ($ 400 per month for CAs + certificate fee)
2) Using an https request that compares the certificate received in the response with the existing one.
3) Using CNAME record in DNS table.
If the above update methods do not work, then you can manually renew the certificate through mail.
