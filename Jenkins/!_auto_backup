Разобратся и сделать такую фичю

I have a backup-ing job that runs every hour and gathers only configuration xmls that are needed to restore jobs.
It is built periodically (every hour from 8:00AM till 6:00PM, Monday-Friday):
0 8-18 * * 1-5

It contains single "Execute shell" build step:

export CUR_PATH=`pwd`
cd $HUDSON_HOME
find -maxdepth 3 -name config.xml|xargs tar cvf configs.tar
mv configs.tar $CUR_PATH/configs.tar

And  "Archive the artifacts" contains only "configs.tar", so we keep the history of jobs.
You can even add some scp to push the tar forward to another server.
