You can use cli command to start Jenkins with ssl key
-
Or edit settings in /etc/sysconfig/jenkins
-
But you need verified cert/ in java format
-
It's possible to create selfsignet cert
https://linuxize.com/post/creating-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate/
in pfx format
https://www.ssl.com/how-to/create-a-pfx-p12-certificate-file-using-openssl/
and convert it in java format
https://wiki.jenkins.io/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=135468777
but most brousers will not allow to open you website using that ssl key.
