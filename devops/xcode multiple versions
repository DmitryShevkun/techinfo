Using multiple versions of xcode.
One can easily support multiple versions by using environment variables. But first one need to install multiple versions on the build server. Here's one strategy:

install multiple versions of xcode
0. Note current config.

xcode-select -p

1. download xcode DMGs from http://developer.apple.com/downloads/

2. enable install from everywhere (under System preferences / Security)

Without that I had problems installing xcode, without graphical feedback, tested on 10.9.5, freshly booted.

Symptoms were:

app not responsive
Getting errors like in /var/log/system.log
Someone attempted to start application App:"Xcode" asn:0x0-1b62b61 pid:57656 refs=6 @ 0x7fa5d9f6df40 but it still has _kLSApplicationLockedInStoppedStateKey=true, so it is is staying stopped. : LASApplication.cp #2468 SetApplicationInStoppedState() q=LSSession 100027/0x186bb queue

3. open DMG file, copy app to /Applications. This might take a while.

4. close /Volumes/Xcode (otherwise installation won't start)

5. start Xcode, accept agreement, install missing packages if necessary. This might take a while. Close xcode after GUI opens.

6. move freshly installed Xcode to new path, e.g.

sudo mv /Applications/Xcode.app /Applications/Xcode6.1.app

(I use this so that the xcode app appears with version number under spotlight)

7. reset default xcode-select if necessary (installation might have changed it / reset to /Applications/Xcode.app)

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode6.1.app

(Note the part above could be fully automated....)

Select the xcode version at runtime
1. Use EnvInject plugin
2. for jobs that require the non default do something like

DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode6.0.1.app/Contents/Developer

under Inject environment variables to the build process

Select the xcode version at runtime (Version 2.0.3 or later)
1. Register the distinguished name and location of the installed Xcode using ’Global Tool Configuration’.
2. Select Xcode registered in 'Global Tool Configuration' in Job's 'Xcode Tools Version'.

That's it.
