Start a cluster by running:
minikube start

Access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the minikube cluster:
minikube dashboard

Once started, you can interact with your cluster using kubectl, just like any other Kubernetes cluster. For instance, starting a server:
kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0

Exposing a service as a NodePort
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080

minikube makes it easy to open this exposed endpoint in your browser:
minikube service hello-minikube

Upgrade your cluster:
minikube start --kubernetes-version=latest

Start a second local cluster (note: This will not work if minikube is using the bare-metal/none driver):
minikube start -p cluster2

Start a cluster with 2 nodes in the driver of your choice:
minikube start --nodes 2 -p multinode-demo

Stop your local cluster:
minikube stop

Delete your local cluster:
minikube delete

Delete all local clusters and profiles
minikube delete --all
